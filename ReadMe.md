## Review
Outstanding course on the basics of Node.js including using npm, grunt, browserify, istanbul and debugging.  Course was well paced and complete.

## Using the folders
If the chapter folder contains a package.json file, you will need run the npm install command in order to install all of the dependencies.
```
~/projects/nodejs/ch11/11_01/start
$ npm install
```
